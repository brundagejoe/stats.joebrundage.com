      <p>Introducing a new way to track your pickup basketball stats that's fast, easy, and free.</p>

    <div class="about">
      <h2>What is it?</h2>
        <p>From an idea created by Taylor Lark, we began as a google spreadsheet to track pickup basketball games in Central Oregon.
        If you're like us, advanced analytics are a huge part of what makes basketball fun. However, pickup games are not timed and
        do not have people on the sidelines to record stats. We have created a way that allows users to enter in stats by watching a
        playback in real time. Those stats are then converted into analytics based primarily off of a 75 PER. Players can track a league
        of their friends, look at rankings, and see leaderboards&mdash; all within a few minutes. This site is currently in production
        and will one day allow input directly from users, but for now, check out already inputted stats by clicking <a href="/pages/season-stats.html">here</a>.</p>
